One last hope

This will be the last you hear from me,
you once promised me an eternity
to forever decay
scarred
to forever shatter

One last hope

This will be the last you hear from me,
a child,
One last hope
blood stained
to forever abandon
to forever deceive

One last hope

say good night
a child,
not but an unrequited love
not but a stolen kiss
not but a gift
so say good night
